# PM_first-steps
Synthetic data generation using Python package [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/), event-log generation with Python and initial analysis using Opensource-Tool [ProM](https://promtools.org/).

### Problem:
During the implementation of a process mining project in a manufacturing German company, it was unfortunately not possible to obtain real process data. 
### Solution: 
To solve the problem and to gain first experiences with process mining, artificial data was generated. Data of a logistic process should be created.
